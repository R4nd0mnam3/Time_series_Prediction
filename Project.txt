ARIMA : 
-   Input : Differentiated series
-   Output : model, forecast, metrics
-   Description  : Selects the best model based on AIC criterion

GRU : 
-   Input : Normalized time series (min-max normalizing), epochs, learning rate
-   Output :model, forecast, metrics
-   Description : Selects the best model based on MSE criterion using L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
-   Improvements : Dropouts to reduce overfitting
-   Problems : 
    -   Lookback parameter becomes so big that It shrinks down the test.
    -   Hidden layers : Creates big training delay
-   Solutions : All of data can in train set, and only predict next week

Workflow :
1.Calibration

    1.1. Data

We want to keep some points to test our trading strategies later on. Therefore we will leave 20% of our dataset to try it completely out of sample.

With the remaining of the dataset we will split 80/20 training/test.

    1.2. Training Parameters Calibration

We first calibrate the training parameters which  for GRUs are learning rate, lamsbda (l2) and epochs. In order to do so we need to define a standard model.
For this purpose we will define a model (hidden size and number of layers) such as hidden size = 8, number of layers = 2.

        1.2.1. Epochs

Ealy stoppage method. Iterate through epoch and see at which step does the MSE stop decreasing.

        1.2.2. LR



        1.2.3 Lambda (L2)



    1.3. Model Parameters Calibration

After having found the training paramters we will search to optimize model paramters : lookback, hidden size and number of layers.

---
We will look for the set of parameters that minimizes the MSE on the test set.
